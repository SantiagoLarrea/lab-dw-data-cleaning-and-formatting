Your goal is to identify customers with a high policy claim amount and a low customer lifetime value.\n","\n","In the Pandas Lab, we only looked at high policy claim amounts because we couldn't look into low customer lifetime values. If we had tried to work with that column, we wouldn't have been able to because customer lifetime value wasn't clean and in its proper format. So after cleaning and formatting the data, let's get some more interesting insights!\n","\n","Instructions:\n","\n","- Review the statistics again for total claim amount and customer lifetime value to gain an understanding of the data.\n","- To identify potential areas for improving customer retention and profitability, we want to focus on customers with a high policy claim amount and a low customer lifetime value. Consider customers with a high policy claim amount to be those in the top 25% of the total claim amount, and clients with a low customer lifetime value to be those in the bottom 25% of the customer lifetime value. Create a pandas DataFrame object that contains information about customers with a policy claim amount greater than the 75th percentile and a customer lifetime value in the bottom 25th percentile.\n","- Use DataFrame methods to calculate summary statistics about the high policy claim amount and low customer lifetime value data. To do so, select both columns of the dataframe simultaneously and pass it to the `.describe()` method. This will give you descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values for both columns at the same time, allowing you to compare and analyze their characteristics."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":86,"id":"211e82b5-461a-4d6f-8a23-4deccb84173c","metadata":{"id":"211e82b5-461a-4d6f-8a23-4deccb84173c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":300},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754217549878,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":60,"user":{"displayName":"Santiago
